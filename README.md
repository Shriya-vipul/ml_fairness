+ Project summary: In this project, we researched Machine Learning bias correction algorithms Conditional Discrimination as well as Fairness-aware Feature Selection. We implemented, evaluated, and compared LM, LPS, and FFS. Implementation and evaluation will be based on the COMPAS dataset, which contains the defendants' recidivsim risk score (COMPAS), race, gender, age, criminal history, prison time, etc. Our goal is to compare the performance (in terms of accuracy and bias correction) and efficiency of the above algorithms for Machine Learning Fairness.
